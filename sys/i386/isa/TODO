1. add support for "soft" configuration network devices
2. split console driver into kbd/vga/other drivers
3. implement additional link layer support items (bpf et al)
4. fd.c: other floppy types, type detection, optional partitions, QIC40/80
5. fd.c: missing controller queue, no unit start, abysmal
6. kbd needs to turn scancodes into keyindexs with state map, then look
   through multinational scan map for foreign keyboards.
